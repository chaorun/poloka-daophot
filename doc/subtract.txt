\subsection subfile Syntax of the "subfile"
a subfile is a very simple text file that describes what should be 
subtracted from what. We define sets of DbImage's, labelled "ref" and
"new". Furthermore, "new" can be split in "new1", "new2",...
Each DbImage within the file will be resampled, and stacked set by
set. Then the ref stack will be subtracted from each new(<n>) stack.

 - "split subtraction" in which case, we compute new1-ref, new2-ref and
new1+new2-ref; the detection will request to find an object in
the 3 subtractions (with different significances). 
 - or a single subtraction in which case new1 and new2 groups are merged,
and we compute new-ref.

  Before subtracting each group of images is aligned and coadded (using
ImagesAlignAndSum). At the moment, seeings in a given stack are 
NOT equalized, because the subtraction
makes use of a kernel fitting (see KernelFit) that can handle "mixed PSF's".

A "subfile" details the contents of these subtraction components through
DbImage names. The choice between a single subtraction and "split" subtraction
is specified by putting "ONE SUBTRACTION" in this file. 
Blank lines in the subfile are ignored.
By default, newmake_sub reads a file named subfile in the current directory.

"FIXGEO" aims at fixing the geometric reference used to align all the images.
Here is an example of a "subfile":

"CONVOLVE REF" is an option to force the reference to be the one convolved no matter
whether it has the best seeing or not. Useful when reference is much higher S/N. 

\code
# subtraction for fieldP1ccd9
REF
502809o09 <SubImage>
502816o09
502817o09
NEW1
504604o09
504605o09
NEW2
504613o09
504614o09
ONE SUBTRACTION
#FIXGEO
502809o09
\endcode

In this specific example, the split of images between NEW1 and NEW2 is
irrelevant since we run a "simple" subtraction (as specified by ONE SUBTRACTION). 

Another Example:
 
\code
REF
master_LDP_D3_r_run16 ref=[2262:4544,10686:16051]
NEW SWARP_STACK
744309o00
744309o01
744309o09
744309o10
744309o18
\endcode
