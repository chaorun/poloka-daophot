(*) dictgen2/codegen BUG ---> (Inheritance)
(*) one header / persister
(*) work out reasonable makefile rule so that persisters are automatically generated
(*) << & >> operators for STL types
( ) set precision automatically for floating point types
( ) new options to dictgen2, so that *__persister.h files can be stored in a single directory
( ) makefile rule, so that these files can be installed with the other header files 
    (maybe just include_HEADERS= *__persister.h may work)
( ) make sure again that classes without persisters can be written out
( ) make sure that no persisters are generated for classes without any version number
( ) generate persisters for templates
( ) pointers
( ) dictionaries
( ) implement constant persisters

( ) clean codegen.[h|cc]
( ) FITS backend
( ) TEXT backend

( ) RTTI 

( ) manipulators, to allow or disallow pointers 
( ) manipulators, to set write depth
